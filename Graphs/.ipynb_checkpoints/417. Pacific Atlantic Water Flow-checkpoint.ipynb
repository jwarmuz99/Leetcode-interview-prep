    "The idea is to start from the nodes that boarder an ocean and see which ones can we get to from those. We have to remember that the condition for water flow will be reversed in such a scenario. Initially, the water flows from the higher or equal nodes to the lower or equal ones. Now, because we reversed the problem statement and are looking for graph paths inwards rather than outwards, we will be creating a connection if the node is greater than or equal to the current node. At the end, we will be intersecting the nodes that can get to either of the oceans. The intersection will give us the nodes that have an access to both of the oceans.\n",

    "We will maintain a hash set for the already visited nodes so that we do not add the duplicates (and do not run through the same node multiple times, thus increasing the time complexity)."
